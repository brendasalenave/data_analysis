> Beautiful is better than ugly. \
> Explicit is better than implicit. \
> Simple is better than complex. \
> Complex is better than complicated. \
> Flat is better than nested. \
> Sparse is better than dense. \
> Readability counts. \
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. \
> Although practicality beats purity. \
> Errors should never pass silently.  \
> Unless explicitly silenced. \
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. \
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. \
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. \
> Now is better than never.  \

> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  \
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  \
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
